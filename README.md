# Project-Campus

The current language Im learning is C++
This language program was chosen because someoneone recommended it to me as well as I wanted to explore it. 
Im curently working through the C++ course on netacad but I am in ways struggling with it. I find it challenging and its not my favourite language to use. I am working through it the best I can 
I have some prior experience with other languages such as Python, Command line, and HTML which I found to be a lot easier.
